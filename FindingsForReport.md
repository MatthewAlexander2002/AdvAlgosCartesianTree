Write a report detailing the following aspects of the implementation:

**A high level outline of the algorithm.**


**The application domain(s) of the algorithm, and its effectiveness therein.**


**The theoretical complexity of the algorithm.**
Recursive: 
    worse case: O(n!) 
    average case: O(?) // figure and fill out

Linear: 
    worse/average/best case: O(n)

**The complexity of your implementation (indicating the level of confidence in any external components used as applicable and necessary).**


**Any compromises, assumptions or changes you made to the algorithm to allow implementation.**


**An explanation and justification of the effectiveness of the tests provided in assuring algorithmic correctness.**


**Any insights or observations that would help someone else implement the same algorithm.**
